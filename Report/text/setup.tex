\section{Hardware Setup}
\label{hardware_setup}

This section goes through the hardware setup used in the research paper. USB uEye UI-122xLE fisheye camera was used as the vision input. The camera has a resolution of 752 Ã— 480 and a frame rate up to 87 fps. Motion blur was minimized due to the high dynamic range and global shutter of the camera. VG400CC-200 solid state gyro which includes a tri-axial gyroscope and tri-axial accelerometer was used. It has an output frequency of 75 Hz with an input range of $\pm$10g and <1.25 mg resolution. The IMU outputs acceleration around its 3-axis along with yaw, pitch and roll.
